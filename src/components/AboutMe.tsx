            My name is Garrett Blankenship. I am a student at Illinois State University, currently studying computer science.
            I hope to double major in both computer science and electrical engineering in order to get a job as a computer engineer.
            I started programming young, but I did not really get into it until high school. I signed up for my high school's 
            computer science classes. I took Programming 1, Programming 2, AP Computer Science Principles, and AP Computer Science A.
            Throughout these classes I learned the key components to a computing system. This goes from converting decimal to binary
            and back, to learning the network layers that make the internet run. I was fortunate enough to have a great teacher for
            these classes, where not many high schools do. While taking these courses, I also participated in the school robotics
            team and went to various coding events with friends. My hobbies that I took up were creating mods for games and hosting
            servers for some of the games as well.
